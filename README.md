# MACHINE-LEARNING-MODEL-IMPLEMENTATION

COMPANY : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME : SIDDHI DEEPAK YEWALE

INTERN ID : CT04DN282

DOMAIN : PYTHON

DURATION : 4 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION :

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning regression model that predicts a student's score based on the number of hours they studied. It's a beginner-friendly implementation using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

 Key Highlights:
Dataset: Student study hours vs scores (CSV from GitHub)

Model Used: Linear Regression (from sklearn)

Goal: Predict a student’s score based on the number of hours studied

 Workflow:
Data Loading: Reads a CSV file containing Hours and Scores.

Data Splitting: Divides data into 80% training and 20% testing sets.

Model Training: Fits a linear regression model on the training data.

Prediction: Predicts test data and also allows custom prediction (e.g., 9.35 hours).

Evaluation Metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score

Visualization: Plots actual vs predicted scores with a regression line.

Use Case Example:
Predict the expected exam score of a student who studied 9.35 hours.
